# Resume

This project consists in some solutions that aim to automate tasks from different environments. So far, the following ones are present:

- A network compost of Cisco routers and switches that uses Ansible to backup configurations and gather some informations like interfaces status, neighbors etc.

- A Fortigate firewall with Python library fortigate-api. This solution started using Ansible, creating groups of objects, but it was changed to the direct use of Python due to the better freedom to handle data.

- Zabbix with the Python library py-zabbix.

# TO DO

- In the network environment, create playbooks with Dell modules.
